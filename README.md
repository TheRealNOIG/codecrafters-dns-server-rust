"In this challenge, you'll build a DNS server that's capable of parsing and
creating DNS packets, responding to DNS queries, handling various record types
and doing recursive resolve. Along the way we'll learn about the DNS protocol,
DNS packet format, root servers, authoritative servers, forwarding servers,
various record types (A, AAAA, CNAME, etc) and more."
